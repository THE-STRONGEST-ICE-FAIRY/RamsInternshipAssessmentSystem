git add .
git commit --amend --no-edit
git push --force

############

Here’s a guide on how to use the commands in your file:

00. Include your changes in the files

0. Go to Terminal Tab > New Terminal

1. git add .
This command stages all the changes in your working directory (including new, modified, or deleted files) for the next commit.
Use case: When you’ve made changes to files and want to include them in your commit.

After running this, all changes will be staged.

2. git commit --amend --no-edit
This command modifies the most recent commit without changing its commit message.
Use case: When you forgot to include some changes in your last commit or need to update it.

3. git push --force
This command forces your local branch to overwrite the remote branch.
Use case: After amending a commit, the commit history changes, so you need to force push to update the remote branch.

When to Use This Workflow
You forgot to include some changes in your last commit.
You need to fix or update the last commit without creating a new one.
